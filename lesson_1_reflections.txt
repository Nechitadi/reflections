How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It is a great way to save time while searching for mistakes in our code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If something esential is lost from my file while editing it, I can easily go back to the older version and repair the error.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pro is the fact that I can manage as I want the size of my commit
The con is that being a human does't allow me to make the perfect commit every time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because some programes contain more files that are linked together and we need to do changes in each file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Easily

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I know that I can come back anytime.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
