What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new hidden folder named .git. It allows me to create commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It keeps only temporarily the files form the working directory, until they are transfered to the repository as a commit.
